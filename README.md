CbC - Cflat Compiler (the ubuntu 64bit version)
====================

The ubuntu 64-bit version of the cbc compiler implemented in the [book "Homemade Compilers."](http://www.ituring.com.cn/book/1308). This project mainly solves the problem of unable to compile and run [cbc](https://github.com/aamine/cbc) on 64-bit machines.

## Direct installation use (on ubuntu 64-bits systems)

### Installation dependencies

> Note: Different ubuntu distributions may rely on inconsistent library names. The code here is the installation command on ubuntu 16.04

```shell
apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-i386 lib32ncurses5 lib32stdc++6 \
        openjdk-8-jre \
        git
```

###  Download & Install cbc

```shell
git clone https://github.com/leungwensen/cbc-ubuntu-64bit.git
cd cbc-ubuntu-64bit && ./install.sh
```

###  Usage

Unlike the original cbc, the -Wa,"--32" -Wl,"-melf_i386" execution parameters need to be added to the 64-bit system.

```shell
cbc -Wa,"--32" -Wl,"-melf_i386" test/hello.cb
./hello
> Hello, World!
```

##  Use docker image (on any 64-bit host environment)

The general principle is to build an environment for cbc compilation and execution based on the 64-bit system of Ubuntu 16.04. Users only need to download the packaged image locally to get the executable cbc, eliminating the need to configure and compile cbc.

### Install docker

### Start the docker daemon process

```shell
eval $(docker-machine env default)
```

### Download the mirror [leungwensen/cbc-ubuntu-64bit](https://hub.docker.com/r/leungwensen/cbc-ubuntu-64bit)

```shell
docker pull leungwensen/cbc-ubuntu-64bit
```

### Perform mirroring 

```shell
docker run -t -i leungwensen/cbc-ubuntu-64bit
```

### Execute cbc 

> The cbc command in the image is an alias of cbc -Wa,--32 -Wl,-melf_i386 and can be executed directly.

```shell
cbc cbc-ubuntu-64bit/test/hello.cb
```

Original descrition
====================


    This is the CbC, Cflat programming language compiler.

Requirements
------------

    To compile cbc itself:

        * JDK 1.5 or later
        * JavaCC 4.0 or later
        * ant
        * make

    To run cbc and compiled program:

        * Linux 2.4 or later
        * util-linux (ld-linux.so.2)
        * GNU libc 2.3 or later
        * GNU binutils (as, ld)


Installation
------------

    To install all files under /usr/local/cbc:

        # sudo ./install.sh
        # sudo ln -s ../cbc/bin/cbc /usr/local/bin/cbc

    To install all files under $HOME/cbc:

        $ ./install.sh $HOME/cbc
        $ ln -s ../cbc/bin/cbc $HOME/bin/cbc


Build
-----

    Edit build.properties for your environment and invoke make:

        $ vi build.properties
        $ make


Test
----

    Invoke "make test":

        $ make test

    Note that you need bash (not bourne sh) to run test scripts.
    ksh or zsh may work.


Usage
-----

    $ cbc --help
